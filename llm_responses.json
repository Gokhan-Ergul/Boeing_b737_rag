When the system is activated, the PASS OXY ON light illuminates and OVERHEAD illuminates on the Master Caution System.\n\nActivating the system causes the masks to drop from the stowage compartments. The oxygen generators are activated when any mask in the unit is pulled down. Pulling one mask down causes all masks in that unit to come down and 100% oxygen flows to all masks. A green in-line flow indicator is visible in the transparent oxygen hose whenever oxygen is flowing to the mask. Oxygen flows for approximately 12 minutes and cannot be shut off. If the passenger oxygen is activated and a PSU oxygen mask compartment does not open, the masks may be dropped manually.\n\nWARNING: When using passenger oxygen, the \u201cNO SMOKING\u201d sign should be strictly observed. Once the generator is activated, the flow of oxygen is constant, whether or not the mask is being worn.\n\nWARNING: Do not use passenger oxygen with cabin altitude below 14,000 feet when smoke or an abnormal heat source is present. The use of passenger oxygen does not prevent the passengers from inhaling smoke.

        "content": "**[Context Text]**\nPassenger Portable Oxygen\nFirst aid and supplemental portable oxygen cylinders are installed at suitable locations in the passenger cabin. The cylinders are fitted with a pressure gage, pressure regulator and an on-off valve. The cylinders are pressurized to 1800 psi. At this pressure and a temperature of 70 degrees Fahrenheit (21 degrees Celsius) the cylinders have a capacity of 4.25 cubic feet (120 liters) of free oxygen. Two continuous flow outlets are provided on each cylinder, one regulates flow at two liters per minute for walk-around; the second outlet provides flow at four liters per minute. The four-liter flow is used for first aid.\n\nDuration can be determined by dividing capacity by outflow (120 liters divided by 4 liters/minute = 30 minutes).\n\n**[Visual Analysis]**\nThe Passenger Portable Oxygen Schematic illustrates the components of the system.\nThe system consists of an OXYGEN CYLINDER.\nAttached to the top of the OXYGEN CYLINDER are an ON-OFF VALVE, a PRESSURE REGULATOR, and a PRESSURE GAUGE.\nA PLACARD is located on the side of the OXYGEN CYLINDER.\nThe oxygen cylinder supplies two CONSTANT FLOW OUTLETS: one providing a 4 LITER FLOW and another providing a 2 LITER FLOW.\nThe schematic shows a user receiving oxygen via a mask connected to one of the constant flow outlets."

        "content": "**[Context Text]**\nFire Extinguishers are located in the flight deck and passenger cabin.\nWater fire extinguishers contain a solution of water mixed with antifreeze. The container is pressurized by a CO2 cartridge when the extinguisher handle is rotated fully clockwise. The extinguisher should be used on fabric, paper or wood fires only.\nTo use the water fire extinguisher:\n* remove from stowage\n* rotate handle fully clockwise\n* aim at base of fire and press trigger.\nCAUTION: Do not use on electrical or grease type fires.\nHalon (BCF) fire extinguishers contain a liquefied gas agent under pressure. The pressure indicator shows an acceptable pressure range, a recharge range, and an overcharged range. A safety pin with a pull ring prevents accidental trigger movement. When released the liquefied gas agent vaporizes and extinguishes the fire. The extinguisher is effective on all types of fires, but primarily on electrical, fuel and grease fires.\n\n**[Visual Analysis]**\nThe Water Fire Extinguisher consists of a main container with a handle located at the top. The handle assembly includes a TRIGGER SAFETY WIRED component, which is connected to a DISCHARGE NOZZLE through which the extinguishing agent is expelled."

The DISCHARGE NOZZLE is located at the front, top of the extinguisher body. The LEVER is positioned above the handle mechanism. The RING SAFETY PIN is inserted through the lever to prevent accidental discharge. A PRESSURE GAUGE is visible on the side of the valve assembly, indicating the extinguisher's charge. The HANDLE is located on the opposite side of the discharge nozzle, below the lever, for carrying and operating the extinguisher. The main body of the cylinder is labeled as containing HALON."
